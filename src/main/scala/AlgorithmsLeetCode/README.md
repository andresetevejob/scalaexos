# twoSum Algorithm

## Brute force solution
The brute force approach is simple. Loop through each element xx and find if there is another value that equals to targetâˆ’x.
Complexity Analysis

Time complexity : O(n^2)
. For each element, we try to find its complement by looping through the rest of array which takes O(n)O(n) time. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n^2)
Space complexity : O(1).
